# Simple Node App from project AyaPay test.

### ****Disclaimer: This is a test project for interview.****



# Overview

I copy the NodeJS code from the repo which it's in email. The original plan was to host all the code, both infrastructure provision terraform code and Nodejs code, in same repo but setting up GitHub actions will be hard and complex, So I separate two different repo for infrastructure provision and NodeJS app.

I write `Dockerfile` for NodeJS app and optimized the code.
